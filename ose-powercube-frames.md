# `ose-powercube-frames` Powercube structure made from (rebar) frames

The outer structure of a [powercube](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Power_Cube) (actually, any cube) can be constructed with frames made from [reinforcing bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebar) (rebar).

In the following, a FreeCAD parametric model is discussed that provides:
- a FreeCAD spreadsheet (`ss`) with
	- parameters (to drive the 3D representation and cutlist)
	- a cutlist with the lengths and numbers of the rebar rods
- a 3D representation of the cube (for "visual proofing" and assembly)
